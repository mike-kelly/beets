# MoBeets

In this forked version of Beets by @mattbiddulph, 1-bar and 2-bar loops can be used.

- To switch between voices, use Enc 2
- Beat Start and Beat End in params are set up for 2-bar loops (range 0 - 15). This is due to the lack of dynamic relations between params (ideally when setting 'bars per loop' = 1, range would update to be 0 - 7). They can still be adjusted for 1-bar loops if required and large values set for a 1-bar loop will not cause errors. The default setting will play the whole loop.

Original readme follows.
